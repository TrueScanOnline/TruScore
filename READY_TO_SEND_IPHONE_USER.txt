Hi! Here's how to test the TrueScan app:

1. Make sure Expo Go is installed from App Store
   (If not: App Store → Search "Expo Go" → Install - latest version)

2. Connect using ONE of these methods:

   METHOD A - Tap the Link (Easiest!):
   - Just tap this link: exp://ghago_g-crwmlw-8081.exp.direct
   - Safari will open automatically
   - Tap "Open in Expo Go?" when prompted
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - Done! ✅

   METHOD B - Copy & Paste in Safari:
   - Copy this URL: exp://ghago_g-crwmlw-8081.exp.direct
   - Open Safari app on your iPhone
   - Tap the address bar at the top
   - Paste the URL
   - Tap "Go"
   - Tap "Open in Expo Go?" when prompted
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - Done! ✅

   METHOD C - Notes App:
   - Copy this URL: exp://ghago_g-crwmlw-8081.exp.direct
   - Open Notes app on iPhone
   - Create a new note
   - Paste the URL in the note
   - Tap the URL (it becomes blue)
   - Tap "Open in Expo Go?" when prompted
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - Done! ✅

IMPORTANT: You don't need to open Expo Go first or find any buttons!
Just tap the link above (exp://ghago_g-crwmlw-8081.exp.direct) or paste it in Safari - that's it!

Note: Both of us can connect at the same time!

If you have any issues, let me know!
