# Batch Completion Strategy - Additive Database

## Current Status
- **Entries:** 548
- **Remaining:** 899 missing
- **Progress:** 38% complete

## Systematic Completion Plan

Given the large volume (899 remaining), I'll continue adding entries in systematic batches:

### Batch 1: E400-E499 (Thickeners) - ✅ IN PROGRESS
- Just added 33 entries
- Need to continue with remaining gaps

### Batch 2: E500-E599 (Acidity Regulators) - NEXT
- Add all missing numbers in this range
- Focus on commonly used ones first

### Batch 3: E600-E699 (Flavor Enhancers) - NEXT
- Add all missing flavor enhancers
- Include variants and salts

### Batch 4: E900-E999 (Sweeteners & Glazing) - NEXT
- Add all missing sweeteners
- Include glazing agents for cosmetics

### Batch 5: E1000-E1521 (Modified Starches & Others) - NEXT
- Add all modified starches
- Include other additives

### Batch 6: E700-E799 (Placeholders) - FINAL
- Add placeholders noting these are antibiotics (not food additives)
- Ensure users get information, not "not available"

## Goal
**Complete database with NO gaps - every E-number from E100 to E1521 will have an entry.**
