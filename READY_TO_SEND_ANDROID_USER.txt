Hi! Here's how to test the TrueScan app:

1. Make sure Expo Go is installed from Play Store
   (If not: Play Store → Search "Expo Go" → Install)

2. Open Expo Go app

3. Connect using ONE of these methods:

   METHOD A - Scan QR Code (Easiest):
   - Tap "Scan QR code" button
   - Scan the QR code I'll send (or from developer's terminal)
   - Done!

   METHOD B - Enter URL Manually:
   - Tap "Enter URL manually" button (or text field)
   - Paste this URL:
     exp://ghago_g-crwmlw-8081.exp.direct
   - Tap "Connect"
   - Done!

4. Wait 10-30 seconds for app to load

5. You can now test the app!

Note: Both of us can connect at the same time!

If you have any issues, let me know!
