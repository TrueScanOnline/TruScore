This is the best choice for environmental sustainability.",
    "orangeFlagDescription": "This product contains palm oil, but its sustainability status is unknown or not verified. Palm oil itself is not inherently bad - when produced sustainably, it can be an efficient crop. However, the majority of palm oil comes from unsustainable sources. The orange flag indicates that the product contains palm oil, and you should look for additional information such as RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) certification to ensure it comes from responsible sources.",
    "redFlagDescription": "This product contains palm oil that is likely from non-sustainable sources. Products with a red flag have been identified as containing palm oil that may contribute to deforestation, habitat destruction, and environmental degradation. This is the most concerning category, as non-sustainable palm oil production is one of the leading causes of rainforest destruction, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. Purchasing these products directly supports practices that threaten endangered species like orangutans, tigers, and elephants, while also contributing significantly to climate change.",
