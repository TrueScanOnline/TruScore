## 🤔 Why They Might See a Login Screen

If your tester is seeing a login screen, it's likely one of these:

### Scenario 1: Expo Go Welcome Screen (NOT a Login)
When first opening Expo Go, it shows a welcome screen with:
- "Sign in" option (optional)
- "Get Started" button (use this!)

**Solution:** Tell them to tap **"Get Started"** or **"Skip"** - no account needed!

### Scenario 2: Expo Account (Optional - NOT Required)
Expo Go has an optional "Sign in" feature, but it's **NOT required** for connecting via URL.

**Solution:** Tell them to:
- Tap **"Skip"** or **"Get Started"**
- Or just tap **"Enter URL manually"** directly

### Scenario 3: They're in Wrong Place
If they see login prompts, they might be:
- On the "Projects" tab (requires login for published projects)
- On the "Profile" tab (requires login for account features)

**Solution:** Tell them to:
- Go to the **"Home"** tab
- Or look for **"Enter URL manually"** at the bottom
