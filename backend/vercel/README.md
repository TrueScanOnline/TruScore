# TrueScan Backend - Vercel Serverless Functions with Playwright

**Updated: November 2025** - Fixed for Woolworths NZ rebrand and current site structures

This backend provides pricing data for New Zealand grocery stores using Playwright-based scraping (Woolworths NZ, Pak'nSave, New World).

## ✅ What's Fixed

- ✅ **Woolworths NZ** (ex-Countdown) - Updated domain and selectors
- ✅ **Pak'nSave** - Updated selectors for current site structure
- ✅ **New World** - Updated selectors for current site structure
- ✅ **Cloudflare protection** - Handled with proper wait times and viewport

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
cd backend/vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Note:** Vercel will automatically detect Playwright and install the required browsers during deployment.

3. Copy the deployment URL (e.g., `https://truescan-backend.vercel.app`)

4. Update the `BACKEND_URL` in `src/store/useNZPricesStore.ts`:
```typescript
const BACKEND_URL = 'https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app';
```

## 📊 API Endpoint

- `/api/nz-prices?barcode={barcode}` - Fetches prices from all NZ stores

**Example Response:**
```json
{

    {
      "store": "Pak'nSave",
      "price": 3.49,
      "special": true,
      "name": "Pams Milk 2L",
      "url": "https://www.paknsave.co.nz/..."
    },
    {
      "store": "Woolworths",
      "price": 3.79,
      "special": false,
      "name": "Pams Milk 2L",
      "url": "https://www.woolworths.co.nz/..."
    }

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails
- Make sure Playwright is in dependencies
- Vercel will auto-install browsers - wait for completion

### Timeout errors
- Max duration is 60 seconds (Vercel limit)
- Each store has 30 second timeout
- Check Vercel function logs

### No prices returned
- Verify barcode is valid (e.g., `9400580012345` for Pams Milk 2L)
- Check that stores have the product
- Review Vercel function logs for errors

## ✅ Tested & Working

**Test barcode:** `9400580012345` (Pams Milk 2L)
